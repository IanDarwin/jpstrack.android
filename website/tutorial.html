<h1>JPSTrack Tutorial </h1>
<p>Thank you for downloading JPSTrack, the little GPX tracker with attitude!
If you are new to the app, note that it is not a traditional "navigation app",
but is a map-maker's tool intended to be most useful for those contributing
the the <a href="https://openstreetmap.org/">Open Street Map</a>,
"the free, editable map of the world."
</p>

<h2>Safety Notice</h2>
<p>
Do not use features of this application while operating a vehicle.
Just start it and forget about it; pay attention to operating the vehicle!
For better results, have one person driving and another person
recording your textual notes, verbal comments, or taking pictures.
You are required by law to operate your vehicle safely and
in accordance with the laws of you your jurisdiction. 
This is free software; the author assumes no responsibility whatever
for what happens to you while using it.
Having the software installed on your device and using it constitutes
your acceptance of this condition.
</p>

<h2>Using jpstrack</h2>
<p>Using the app is actually pretty simple. 
There are three main buttons in one row
</p>
<table border='1'>
<tr><td>Start</td><td>starts recording a GPX track</td></tr>
<tr><td>Pause/Resume</td><td>pauses and resumes</td></tr>
<tr><td>Stop</td><td>Closes the file.</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
Note that when you start recording, the actual filename is displayed to
the right of the Start button.
</p>
<p>
A second row of buttons controls the adjunct functions:
</p>
<table border='1'>
<tr><td>Voice Note</td><td>Start dictating a note.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Text Note</td><td>Start typing a note.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Take Picture</td><td>Take a snapshot 
(not currently available on BlackBerry Playbook).</td></tr>
</table>

<p>
The log window appears below this row of buttons on small-screen
devices, and in the right half of the screen on devices like tablets.
</p>

<h2>Uploading Data</h2>
<p>To have your traces uploaded automatically when you complete them, just enable
this feature in Settings, and enter your OSM password. You will be prompted for your OSM 
password when you press Stop to end a recording.
<p>If you don't have an OSM account, you should probably
<a href='https://www.openstreetmap.org/user/new'>Sign Up for an OSM account</a>
sometime soon while you are getting started with mapping.
</p>
<p>If the auto-upload fails, or you just would rather, you can also manually upload your data. 
Or you may just want to import your data into JOSM on your desktop.
In either case, connect your Android Device to your computer,
mount it as a USB device, and use a program like JOSM to upload the GPX files.
</p>
<p>
A File Manager feature is planned for jpstrack to make on-demand uploading simpler.
