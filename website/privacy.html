<h1>JpsTrack.Android: Privacy Policy</h1>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>
JpsTrack will never capture identifiable information about you without your consent.
This app does not communicate with our servers at all, except to view static HTML pages.
The app obviously captures your location information, as that is the intent of the application.
"By using the JpsTrack application, you consent to storing your location information.
By using the Upload feature, you consent to your location information being transmitted to 
OpenStreetMap.org (OSM), where their privacy policy applies.
You consented to this policy when you created your OpenStreetMap account."
</p>
<h2>Permissions Used
<p>
Here is a list of the permissions we ask Android for, 
and why we ask for each one:
</p>

<table border='1'>
<tr><th>Perm</th><th>Why</th></tr>
<tr><td>ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION</td><td>To find out where you are.</th></tr>
<tr><td>ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION</td><td>To find out where you are.</th></tr>
<tr><td>WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE</td><td>To save notes and photos to your SD card or storage.</th></tr>
<tr><td>RECORD_AUDIO</td><td>To let you take voice notes.</th></tr>
<tr><td>PERSISTENT_ACTIVITY</td><td>To keep the program running while mapping.</th></tr>
<tr><td>INTERNET</td><td>To upload data to openstreetmap's database, only if you provide an account and password,
		and for uploading anonymous crash reporting info.</th></tr>
</table>

<h2>Data Details</h2>
<p>
Note that the mobile application saves some of this data onto your device, but we do not capture ANY of it
to our web service. 
We do save your OpenStreetMap account name onto your device.
We do not save your OSM password, out of an abundance of caution.
The application is open source so you can verify this yourself, by looking at
<a href='https://github.com/IanDarwin/jpstrack.android'>the github repo.</a>
<p>
The only time we upload identifiable stuff is to OpenStreetMap. 
In that case, you are covered by OpenStreetMap's own privacy policy,
which we have no control over.
