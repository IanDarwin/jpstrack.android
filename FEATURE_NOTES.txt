This program collects data for inclusion into OpenStreetMap,
the free, editable map of the world. This is NOT a Navigation
application (there are many of those in the Market already).
It is different from the "Vespucci" app in that, unlike Vespucci,
it does NOT try to be an OSM editor. In the author's experience,
current Android devices do not have the I/O capability to do this
job well. I recommend uploading the files (from /sdcard/jpstrack)
to a desktop PC and running the JOSM editor or even using the
web-based editor on the OSM site.

The program collects data once you press the Start button, and
goes until you PAUSE or SAVE. PAUSE can be resumed with the 
RESUME button. The SAVE button ends a run and closes the file.
You can optionally have tracks uploaded automatically when
you save them.

There is also voice notes, text notes, and pictures.
All are saved, along with the GPX files, in 
/sdcard/jpstrack.android.

This is early release software, please see the Release Notes
before you decide it's buggy; we know about most of the bugs that
are in this version and will fix them as we have time...
It's an open source application; if you are a coder, please
visit https://github.com/IanDarwin/jpstrack.android,
clone the repo, fix the issue, and file a pull request!
