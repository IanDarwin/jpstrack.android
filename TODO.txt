JPSTrack is a program for saving tracks of where you have travelled
with your GPS-enabled mobile device. It is mainly intended for
those who wish to contribute map data to OpenStreetMap.org,
the free editable map of the world. Note that it is not
a "navigation" app; it will not show you maps and it will not
help you find your way! It can only record where you have been.
There are lots of other navigation apps in the Market, please use
one of them if you want to get around.
