This is a late Alpha/Early Beta release. Note the following:

- Do NOT use the application with the USB connected in debug mode;
  there are several places where it will NPE crash if the /sdcard
  is not available.

- the Take Picture button isn't implemented yet.

- Changing the directory to save in has a UI under Settings,
  but is ignored at present.

- The menu icons are borked, but the text is OK.

- The About box has no OK button. Use the back-arrow button.

- There are no language-translation files yet so the program 
  only works in English.

- Sound files are saved as standard MP3's, but the CODEC used
  is not always available on the desktop.

If you find any new ways to crash it, please email.
