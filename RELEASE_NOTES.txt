Version 0.8 - 2014-01-27

Minor bug fix and enhancements.

Fixes a bug in the generated XML that caused strict XML parsers used
in some third-party software to reject the GPX files.

Fixes a bug that would occasionally cause a crash if you rotated the 
device while recording GPS.

Version 0.7 - first release to the Android Play Store and BlackBerry World.

This is a Beta release. Please note the following:

- We try to ensure that the GPX file is closed correctly, but this
  does not always happen. If your destination app cannot read the file,
  try opening it with a plain-text editor (good ole vi!) and add
  these three "end tag" lines after the last end-trackpoint (</trkpt>) tag.
    </trkseg>
	</trk>
	</gpx>
	
- Do NOT use the application with the USB connected and the SDCard
  exported to your desktop, on platforms where this disables all
  Android Apps's access to the /sdcard folder, as there may be
  some places where the app might crash if the /sdcard
  is not available.

- There are no language-translation files yet so the program 
  only works in English. 
  
  Hay una traduccion muy cruda para Espanol, pero se puede morir
  de reir si intenta usarlo. No pagamos las cuentas funerales que
  resultan, ni ningunas otras consecuencias. Sirvense ayudanos
  con una traduccion mas correcta?

- Voice Note files are saved as standard MP3's, but the CODEC used
  is not always available on the desktop.

- The footprint 'tracks' on the icon look more like missiles
  than the intended footprints. Somebody with a bit more
  artist-fu should work on them.
