This is a late Alpha/Early Beta release. Note the following:

- Do NOT use the application with the USB connected because this
  disables Android Apps's access to the /sdcard folder, and 
  there are several places where it will NPE crash if the /sdcard
  is not available.

- Changing the directory to save in has a UI under Settings,
  but is ignored at present.

- The menu icons are borked, but the text is OK.

- There are no language-translation files yet so the program 
  only works in English.

- Sound files are saved as standard MP3's, but the CODEC used
  is not always available on the desktop.

- The footprint 'tracks' on the icon look more like missiles
  than the intended footprints. Somebody with a bit more
  artist-foo should work on them.

If you find any new ways to crash it, please email.
