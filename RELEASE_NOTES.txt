This is a Beta release. Please note the following:

- We try to ensure that the GPX file is closed correctly, but this
  does not always happen. If your destination app cannot read the file,
  try opening it with a plain-text editor (good ole vi!) and add
  these three "end tag" lines after the last end-trackpoint (</trkpt>) tag.
    </trkseg>
	</trk>
	</gpx>
	
- Do NOT use the application with the USB connected and the SDCard
  exported to your desktop, as obviously this disables all
  Android Apps's access to the /sdcard folder, and 
  there are several places where the app might crash if the /sdcard
  is not available.

- There are no language-translation files yet so the program 
  only works in English. 
  
  Hay una traduccion muy cruda para Espanol, pero se puede morir
  de reir si intenta usarlo. No pagamos las cuentas funerales que
  resultan, ni ningunas otras consecuencias.

- Voice Note files are saved as standard MP3's, but the CODEC used
  is not always available on the desktop.

- The footprint 'tracks' on the icon look more like missiles
  than the intended footprints. Somebody with a bit more
  artist-fu should work on them.

If you find any new ways to crash it, please email or use this:
