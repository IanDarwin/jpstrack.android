JPSTrack is a map-making tool for OpenStreetMap.

=== HowTo

Look, if you just want to run this, 
link:$$https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=jpstrack.android$$[get it from Google's Play Store].
You do *not* have to build it from source to use it.

If you do want to build this from source, you must rename one sample file, in res/raw.
Directions are contained in the sample file in that directory.

Once that's done, it should compile under either Eclipse or Maven,
assuming you have the Android SDK installed.

Oh, for now, the Eclipse classpath is not Mavenized, so create an
Eclipse classpath variable M2_REPO set to $HOME/.m2/repositor, 
and extend it to darwinsys-api-1.0.3.jar
Or Mavenize .classpath and send me a pull request.
