= jpstrack Test Plan

== Testing with canned data

Untried. Feed a GPX file into the Emulator settings.

== Testing with real data

Load the app onto a real device (needs GPS, d'oh!).

Go outside where the device can see the sky. When it sees enough satellites,
it will show the lat/long/alt in the main window.

Press the Start button.

Move at least 10 feet in one direction. A changed reading should appear.

Press Pause: it should stop. Press Resume: it should continue.

Press Voice Note. It should let you dictate.

Press Text Note. Type "Hello JpsTrack" or something in the top, and save.

Press Take Picture. It should show a camera preview. Take a picture of
something (anything), and it should ask you to OK it, and it will save.

Tap the Save button. It should give you a saved filename.

Plug the phone into a computer.  Connect to it via `ADB -d shell` and
ensure that /sdcard/Download/jpstrack contains a GPX file, a text file, a sound
file, and an image, all with current timestamps.
