Summary: jpstrack lets you collect data for import into OpenStreetMap using your device's GPS
Description:
The Android version of jpstrack lets you collect data for import into OpenStreetMap using your device's GPS.
The JavaSE version works with gpsd to use whatever GPS device you have available.
Data are stored in GPX format which can be loaded into OpenStreetMap for editing,
and might be useful in Goole Earth or in testing a different Android app with the ADB tools.
.
Maintainer Notes: you have to build https://github.com/IanDarwin/jpstrack as a library first.
I hope to get this into Maven Central "someday".
